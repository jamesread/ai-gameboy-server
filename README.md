vba-game-debugger
=================

A project with java bindings to VisualBoyAdvance, and current wrappers for decoding RAM in generation 1 Pokemon games.

The current objective is to rebuild enough of the game state to be used by an AI bot to complete the game. The custom debugger could easily be used to build support for more games in the future.
